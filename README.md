# Python String Manipulation Program

This project will load a list of names and grades for demonstration of using string methods in Python.

The data/students.txt file should be downloaded and placed in the /data subdirectory beneath where the program will reside.

Classroom instruction will focus on cleaning up the student names
Removing the header row from the list
Removing the grade level from the list
Changing format to Lastname, Firstname Middle.
Sorting the list alphabetically
Replacing the initial "names" list with the modified "students" list
Identifying your name and placing it in all uppercase letters.
